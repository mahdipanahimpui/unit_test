upload = Mock()

## methods and attrs is not defined

# assert_called: check a method is called before
upload.send.assert_called    # is not called yet, assert False

# count method calls
upload.one.call_count  # result is 0
upload.send.call_count # result is 2


# return value of mock, to change the value reutrned by a method
